phrases:
    - "Aye, I'll take you onto the Sea of the White Oak. As long as you can pay. And
      if we all drown, I don't get ANYTHING - do you hear! Wait..."
    - "Yes, I've done it before. Well, I've sailed around the edge, where it's safe.
      But I'm up for a challenge. You'll have to get the charts though."
    - "(On the Sea of the White Oak) Many an unsuspecting ship has set out north on
      the Silver Sea and got caught in the current dragging them in to the Sea of the
      White Oak. There's a channel in the rocks where the current is, meaning the
      ship is safe... for a while. Then The Six Devils make their appearance: six
      razor-sharp pillars of rock rising up from the surface. Most ships... manage to
      turn around. And often, the last thing the crew sees is the pale moon over the
      ocean, reflected in the ripples caused by the rocks under the surface. White
      light glittering in a pattern stretched out to the left and right like branches
      of some terrible oak. Most ships are then dragged backwards and are dashed
      against the devils. Some are strong enough to resist the flow, but catch their
      keel in their vain attempt to find a safe route home. The sea is a graveyard of
      ships and naive intentions."
    - "Arr, I'll take yer. I've got a boat that's perfect for the job - small and
      nimble it be. I'll want 2 gold per day, expenses covered, and repairs to the
      boat for any damage incurred."
    - "Beware of Salvus Island. It's filled with poisonous snakes! But don't worry -
      they only attack if they're scared. And they're far more scared of you than you
      are of them."
    - "(Instructions to crew about The Six Devils) It will take us about an hour and
      a half to reach the rock fields, then a further three to get to the devils.
      Rowers, rest up and eat a good lunch when we're about an hour off - you'll need
      your strength. Cox, keep us pointing forward, then steer northeast when we're
      an hour away... I'll call out the time. That'll take us to the slower edges of
      the current. And then... the fun will begin!"
    - "(With an hour to go before reaching the Devils) Right - we can all see the
      devils. Cox, steer northeast. Rowers, eat a hearty meal. Take off anything
      that'll hinder you swimming in the event that we founder."
