Bailer House
============

Overview
--------

A large house, now abandoned, that belonged to the Bailer family that used to be in
charge of the village; they left in the Year of Copper Smoke, Arborean era, and were
lost at sea.

It sits on the northern edge of the village, only 20 metres from the cliff edge.

It now lies in a state of extreme disrepair. It took nearly a year for the owners to be
declared dead, at which point the servants left. Not long afterwards it had been
burgled multiple times.

Approach and external
---------------------

The northernmost row of houses in Wherry Tar is split in two, with a dirt road leading
north between them. As you travel down this road, with long grass either side and
occasionally in the road, you see the large house about 50 m ahead.

Garden
------

There's a small lawn at the back of the house, between the house and the cliff edge.
There's a fountain in it; it's broken and filled with grimy water.

There's a broken wire fence at the end of the lawn.

Looking down from the cliff edge gives a good view of the shipyard.

Inside - ground floor
---------------------

It's dim. There's a damp, rotting smell.

The door opens into a large open-plan room that fills most of the ground floor. In
the centre is a huge brick fireplace with openings on the left and right side.
Throughout the room stone pillars support the ceiling. Most of the windows are
broken. There's a staircase against the left (east) wall which has rotted and fallen
apart. Near the base of the staircase is a door.

Through the door are a kitchen and servant's quarters for one servant.

Inside the large fireplace are some "rungs" cut into the brickwork. Climbing up these
you will eventually reach a ledge, just above the second floor. You can just about
stand up on the ledge, and there's a metal door in front of you. It has a lock of the
type that can be opened from the inside, but from outside you'd need a key - now long
lost.

Inside - upper floor
--------------------

At the top of the staircase is a landing. There's a door on the right leading to a
what appears to have been a medium-sized bedroom; there's a metal bed frame tipped up
on its side. There's a small table, two chairs, and a bookshelf lying haphazardly
around the room.

Full list of what the second floor rooms once were (now in severe disrepair):
1. Guest room with small en-suite toilet.
2. Wardrobe room with rails down both sides.
3. Master bedroom, with small en-suite toilet.
4. Child's bedroom.
5. Airing cupboard.
6. Larger servant's room.
7. Smaller servant's room.
8. Smaller servant's room.
9. Bathroom.

Inside - hidden room
--------------------

Through the metal door hidden at the top of the chimney is a small 15x20ft. room.
This room is within the attic, and you can get into the rest of the attic through a
tiny door in the opposite wall. The rest of the attic isn't used - it's not got a
proper floor, just wooden beams.

There's a desk and chair. There are a few books on the desk about the history of
Wherry Tar and the surrounding area.

Next to the desk is a large safe. Inside the safe are a set of charts of the seas in
the surrouding areas.
