Wherry Tar
==========

A ship building village that also does some fishing. The village proper is on the
northwest tip of Cape Silver, at the top of the cliffs (which are about 40 metres
high), which are set back from the sea a little way. At the bottom of the cliffs,
Northward from the village, is a large shipyard. Slightly west of the shipyard is a
wharf used for fishing boats. There are amenities and a few small houses between the
wharf and the shipyard.

A steep road connects these to the village at the top of the cliffs; it exits the
village eastwards, drops down with the ground, then loops north and to the west,
meeting up with the shipyard.

History
-------

Wherry Tar started as a small hamlet of boat makers who sold their products to the
fishing villages to the south. Over time it has grown into a large, prosperous
village. Ships built here are widely regarded as some of the most reliable in the
region; their sturdiness is attributed to the skills passed down generations of
shipbuilders, who once made ships to sail on the Sea of the White Oak.

Once, an ancient red dragon terrorised the settlements in the area, but some brave
adventurers dared sail on the Sea of the White Oak, found its lair, and slew it.

Those adventurers retired in Wherry Tar, and informally took over as village elders.
Their offspring carried on in this role, helping to run the village. However, by the
Year of Copper Smoke, Arborean Era (when they disappeared), only the Bailer family
was left; they were wealthy, distant and no longer highly regarded by the people.
