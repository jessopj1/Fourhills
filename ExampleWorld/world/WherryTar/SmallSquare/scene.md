Small Square
============

A small square just inside the village; the southern road to the village ends here.

There's a butchers, fishmonger, and a few small inns, though nothing that can stable
horses in the square itself. However, if you go down the road on the northwest
corner, you'll get to The Leaden Anchor, an inn with stables.

If you go down the road on the northeast corner, then turn left, you get to the main
village square.
