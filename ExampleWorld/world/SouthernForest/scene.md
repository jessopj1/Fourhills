Southern Forest
===============

Little light gets through the forest's thick canopy. There is an undergrowth with a
large number of ferns in it, but it's not so thick that you can't get through. It
doesn't count as difficult terrain. Larger animals may struggle, though.

From above, a couple of small clearings are visible; there is one to the east, one to
the southeast, and one northeast of the centre. They are natural glades; the one to
the northeast is filled with bluebells, while the other two have carpets of grass.
There's a small lake near the centre of the forest, and a cave to the south.

There are many dangerous creatures here, such as Example Monster, and Example Monster
2.
